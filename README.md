# Proiect-C
 Project made at a facultative course from second year.
 The C programming course is a colaboration of UBB and Bitdefender.
 The scope of the project was to implement basic abstrect data structures 
 (vector, list, heap, hash map and balanced binary tree - AVL here) in ANSI C.
 We also made a tester that was used parse files and test the structures 
 with the input given in the files.
